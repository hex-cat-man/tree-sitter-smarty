# tree-sitter-smarty

A [Smarty] grammar for [Tree-sitter].

## Development

This parser is currently used to explore the usage and capabilities of
[Tree-sitter]. It is very limited and not meant for use. I hope to expand it
into something useful eventually, but you know how it is with personal projects
;)
